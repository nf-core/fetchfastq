## [[1.12.0](https://github.com/nf-core/fetchngs/releases/tag/1.12.0)] - 2024-02-29

### :warning: Major enhancements

- The Aspera CLI was recently added to [Bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/aspera-cli) and we have added it as another way of downloading FastQ files in addition to the existing FTP and sra-tools support. In our limited benchmarks on all public Clouds we found ~50% speed-up in download times compared to FTP! FTP downloads will still be the default download method (i.e. `--download_method ftp`) but you can choose to use sra-tools or Aspera using `--download_method sratools` or `--download_method aspera`, respectively. We would love to have your feedback!
- The `--force_sratools_download` parameter has been deprecated in favour of using `--download_method <method>` to explicitly specify the download method; available options are `ftp`, `sratools` or `aspera`.
- Support for Synapse ids has been dropped in this release. We haven't had any feedback from users whether it is being used or not. Users can run earlier versions of the pipeline if required.
- We have significantly refactored and standardised the way we are using nf-test within this pipeline. This pipeline is now the current, best-practice implementation for nf-test usage on nf-core. We required a number of features to be added to nf-test and a huge shoutout to [Lukas Forer](https://github.com/lukfor) for entertaining our requests and implementing them within upstream :heart:!

## [[1.7](https://github.com/nf-core/fetchngs/releases/tag/1.7)] - 2022-07-01

### :warning: Major enhancements

Support for GEO ids has been dropped in this release due to breaking changes introduced in the NCBI API. For more detailed information please see [this PR](https://github.com/nf-core/fetchngs/pull/102).

As a workaround, if you have a GEO accession you can directly download a text file containing the appropriate SRA ids to pass to the pipeline:

- Search for your GEO accession on [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo)
- Click `SRA Run Selector` at the bottom of the GEO accession page
- Select the desired samples in the `SRA Run Selector` and then download the `Accession List`

This downloads a text file called `SRR_Acc_List.txt` that can be directly provided to the pipeline e.g. `--input SRR_Acc_List.txt`.

### Enhancements & fixes

- [#97](https://github.com/nf-core/fetchngs/pull/97) - Add support for generating nf-core/taxprofiler compatible samplesheets.
- [#99](https://github.com/nf-core/fetchngs/issues/99) - SRA_IDS_TO_RUNINFO fails due to bad request
- Add `enum` field for `--nf_core_pipeline` to parameter schema so only accept supported pipelines are accepted

## [[1.6](https://github.com/nf-core/fetchngs/releases/tag/1.6)] - 2022-05-17

- [#57](https://github.com/nf-core/fetchngs/pull/57) - fetchngs fails if FTP is blocked
- [#89](https://github.com/nf-core/fetchngs/pull/89) - Improve detection and usage of the NCBI user settings by using the standardized sra-tools modules from nf-core.
- [#93](https://github.com/nf-core/fetchngs/pull/93) - Adjust modules configuration to respect the `publish_dir_mode` parameter.
- [[nf-core/rnaseq#764](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/764)] - Test fails when using GCP due to missing tools in the basic biocontainer
- Updated pipeline template to [nf-core/tools 2.4.1](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/releases/tag/2.4.1)

- Finish porting the pipeline to the updated Nextflow DSL2 syntax adopted on nf-core/modules
  - Bump minimum Nextflow version from `21.04.0` -> `21.10.3`
  - Removed `--publish_dir_mode` as it is no longer required for the new syntax

### Enhancements & fixes

## [[1.4](https://github.com/nf-core/fetchngs/releases/tag/1.4)] - 2021-11-09

### Enhancements & fixes

- Convert pipeline to updated Nextflow DSL2 syntax for future adoption across nf-core
- Added a workflow to download FastQ files and to create samplesheets for ids from the [Synapse platform](https://www.synapse.org/) hosted by [Sage Bionetworks](https://sagebionetworks.org/).
- SRA identifiers not available for direct download via the ENA FTP will now be downloaded via [`sra-tools`](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools).
- Added `--force_sratools_download` parameter to preferentially download all FastQ files via `sra-tools` instead of ENA FTP.
- Correctly handle errors from SRA identifiers that do **not** return metadata, for example, due to being private.
- Retry an error in prefetch via bash script in order to allow it to resume interrupted downloads.
- Name output FastQ files by `{EXP_ACC}_{RUN_ACC}*fastq.gz` instead of `{EXP_ACC}_{T*}*fastq.gz` for run id provenance
- [[#46](https://github.com/nf-core/fetchngs/issues/46)] - Bug in sra_ids_to_runinfo.py
- Added support for [DDBJ ids](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/index-e.html). See examples below:

- Added `--sample_mapping_fields` parameter to create a separate `id_mappings.csv` and `multiqc_config.yml` with selected fields that can be used to rename samples in general and in [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/docs/#bulk-sample-renaming)

## [[1.0](https://github.com/nf-core/fetchngs/releases/tag/1.0)] - 2021-06-08

Initial release of nf-core/fetchngs, created with the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) template.

## Pipeline summary

Via a single file of ids, provided one-per-line the pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Resolve database ids back to appropriate experiment-level ids and to be compatible with the [ENA API](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/retrieval/programmatic-access.html)
2. Fetch extensive id metadata including direct download links to FastQ files via ENA API
3. Download FastQ files in parallel via `curl` and perform `md5sum` check
4. Collate id metadata and paths to FastQ files in a single samplesheet

## Supported database ids

Currently, the following types of example identifiers are supported:

| `SRA`        | `ENA`        | `GEO`      |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| SRR11605097  | ERR4007730   | GSM4432381 |

## Pipeline summary

Via a single file of ids, provided one-per-line the pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Resolve database ids back to appropriate experiment-level ids and to be compatible with the [ENA API](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/retrieval/programmatic-access.html)
2. Fetch extensive id metadata including direct download links to FastQ files via ENA API
3. Download FastQ files in parallel via `curl` and perform `md5sum` check
4. Collate id metadata and paths to FastQ files in a single samplesheet

## Supported database ids

Currently, the following types of example identifiers are supported:

| `SRA`        | `ENA`        | `GEO`      |

## Introduction

**nf-core/fetchfastq** is a bioinformatics pipeline to fetch metadata and raw FastQ files from public databases. At present, the pipeline supports SRA / ENA / GEO ids (see [usage docs](https://nf-co.re/fetchfastq/usage#introduction)).

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies.

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/fetchfastq/results).

## Pipeline summary

Via a single file of ids, provided one-per-line the pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Resolve database ids back to appropriate experiment-level ids and to be compatible with the EBI API
2. Fetch extensive id metadata including direct download links to FastQ files via ENA API
3. Download FastQ files in parallel via `curl` and perform `md5sum` check
4. Collate id metadata and paths to FastQ files in a single samplesheet

The columns in the auto-created samplesheet can be tailored to be accepted out-of-the-box by selected nf-core pipelines, these currently include [nf-core/rnaseq](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq) and [nf-core/viralrecon](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon). You can use the `--nf_core_pipeline` to customise this behaviour e.g. `--nf_core_pipeline rnaseq`. More pipelines will be supported in due course as we adopt and standardise samplesheet input across nf-core.

## Quick Start

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation) (`>=21.04.0`)

2. Install any of [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/), [`Podman`](https://podman.io/), [`Shifter`](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/) or [`Charliecloud`](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/) for full pipeline reproducibility _(please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))_

3. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

    ```console
    nextflow run nf-core/fetchfastq -profile test,<docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute>
    ```

    > * Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.
    > * If you are using `singularity` then the pipeline will auto-detect this and attempt to download the Singularity images directly as opposed to performing a conversion from Docker images. If you are persistently observing issues downloading Singularity images directly due to timeout or network issues then please use the `--singularity_pull_docker_container` parameter to pull and convert the Docker image instead. Alternatively, it is highly recommended to use the [`nf-core download`](https://nf-co.re/tools/#downloading-pipelines-for-offline-use) command to pre-download all of the required containers before running the pipeline and to set the [`NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` or `singularity.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html?#singularity-docker-hub) Nextflow options to be able to store and re-use the images from a central location for future pipeline runs.
    > * If you are using `conda`, it is highly recommended to use the [`NXF_CONDA_CACHEDIR` or `conda.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/conda.html) settings to store the environments in a central location for future pipeline runs.

4. Start running your own analysis!

    ```console
    nextflow run nf-core/fetchfastq -profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute> --input ids.txt
    ```
